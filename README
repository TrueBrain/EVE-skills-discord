# EVE Skills to Discord bridge

This Discord bot reads your Skill Queue every 30 minutes, and reports the current state and changes in a Discord channel + thread.

## Usage

Type `/monitor` in ‚Å†general, and follow the link.
After authenticating with the character you want to monitor, a new channel will be created under characters.
Here your current queue and activity (related to skills) will be published.

You can use the Discord notification system to get active notification for any skill-related activity.

## Limitations

Discord limits a server to 500 channels.
Be mindful of this limitation.
